                            <p>I started my course TU859 in 2021. I chose this course due to my passion for computers which I have had since a young age. Growing up, I played video games and learned basic code through computing classes in secondary school
                                and websites such as Khan Academy. I hope that after my studies I will persue a career in the IT sector.

                            <p>I'm a first year student at Technological university Dublin, Tallaght Campus. I am studying Computer Science. I am aiming to take the Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence. I descovered my interest in computers when
                                I came across problem solving computer challenges and interesting computer contents such as Google CTF, Linux operating systems as well as internet coding contents.

                            <p>I was born in Romania, where at age five I discovered my passion for computers and everything about them by learning to read using a keyboard. I have chosen this course since it contains two of the things I am most interested
                                in: Computers and Languages. By growing in a multicultural enivronment, I learned a lot of languages and would always like to learn more. So far, TU861 seems like the perfect course for me and I will definitely go through
                                with it.
